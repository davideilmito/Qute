Walking helps the cardiovascular system, helps to relax the mind and to produce endorphins and that it is good for muscles and joints and for both us and our friend, walking the dog is certainly a healthy activity.                                 Walking the dog should never be reduced to just getting him to fulfill his physiological needs and go home, as this will inevitably produce an unhappy dog, going out three times a day for about half an hour each, it will be fine.", timer: 1800, name: "Walk", points: 10)

Music therapy is used as a natural anti-anxiety remedy and to help with sleep disorders, and it's easy to use the same technique for your puppy or adult dog.                                            Certain music genres have been proven to be more soothing for your dog than others, such as classical music, reggae and soft rock.", timer: 300, name: "Music", points: 3)

In fact, talking to your dog allows them to keep their attention constant on us when we talk about him or we talk to him, also developing a strong ability to know how to discern topics, in relation to the tone, rhythm and volume of the conversation.                                                  Also, talking to our pets helps us to release stress, confide in each other and to feel lighter.", timer: 300, name: "Storytelling", points: 5)

It can be done anywhere and will help drain a lot of energy your dog accumulates if he stays indoors for several hours.                                      You won’t need special tools, just some tasty prizes or balls you have at home.                                                     This game can be played both outside and at home, but for the first few times it is better to limit yourself to a smaller space.                                                   The important thing to do, if you play for the first time, is to start from a very low difficulty level, then gradually increase the rank.", timer: 600 ,name: "hide and seek", points: 6)

This game is very useful to create a positive association between fun and the presence of the owner, sharing positive feelings and making the dog grow pleasure and desire to be close to us.                                             Furthermore, playing and engaging your dog in daily activities causes him to let off steam and reduces the possibility of him draining his energies on wrong occupations, also helping us stress out.", timer: 900, name: "Retrieving game", points: 8)

It’s recommended to brush your dog all over the back, chest and belly, while it’s not, if not used to this type of contact, to brush your dog on the legs, tail and neck.                            Brushing your dog it's good for both of you: for a dog, being brushed is comparable to a caress or a massage, in fact they love this type of attention, which is very pleasant, relaxing and restful.                            For humans, it’s a relaxing moment, that can also be useful for strengthening the relationship with the animal.", timer: 300, name: "Brush your dog", points: 3)

Many dogs love to be cuddled behind the ears, under the chin or on the chest, others like to be cuddled on the stomach or petted on the hips, placing your hand on the dog's side, giving it long caresses, until you get close to the end of his back.                    We suggest you to let your dog, since the puppy age, get gradually used to receive cuddles in specific points (such as head cuddles with open hand, an annoying gesture of dominance), so it will understand that these touches are positive, accepting them.                                              Then try not to stress your dog doing something it doesn’t like, treating and cuddling him as if he were a baby or a soft toy, not a game to play with.                                              Cuddling a pet reduces your stress levels, letting the oxytocin quintuple and the endorphins double in your body, that’s why we feel well-being when we pet a dog.", timer: 300, name: "Cuddle", points: 3)

It’s important to give your dog a pleasant massage because you'll spend time with it, being able to check if there are particular marks on its body, controlling its health.", timer: 600, name:"Massage",points: 6)
